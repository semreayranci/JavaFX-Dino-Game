Also I learned a big lesson from this assignment that is: 

I need to improve my prioritization ability. 
Because I spent a lot of time simulating gravity and other things in the assignment as well,
yet they aren't as good as I intended at first.




When it came to collision detection, my willpower has run out and I quit...  
(probably it is not that hard to implement but it is what it is)
