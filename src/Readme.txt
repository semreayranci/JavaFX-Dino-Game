
Updates: Collision detection and enabling new game.



Additional Feautures:

When the down arrow key is pressed:

	if the dinosaur is jumping, it immediately turns back to the ground.

	and if you keep pressing the down arrow key, the dino will duck and additionally it will show a running animation.
	(the dinoDuck images are pretty lame because I painted its boundaries  as the same color as the canvas, because it's the 
	fastest solution that I had.)

When esc or M pressed:
	

	esc simply closes the game.

	on the other hand, as stated in the game itself, M is the key for mute/unmute the music.
